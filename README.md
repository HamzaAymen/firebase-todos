## Description 📃
**Firebase Todos** is a project that is built with **React & Firebase** and some other libraries.

The main goal of the project was to practice **Firebase** and figure out how to integrate with Recat, so I choose a simple todo app because **it covers all the CRUD operations you can do with Firebase Store.**

Additionally, I used the **Firebase Authentication** to the app, where you have two options to use the app, **one with your email and the other using Google.**

## Developing Details 🧑‍💻
The website mainly used **React & Firebase**, all the other libraries are for making the developing experience better.

I used **react-router for routing**, along with a library called **js-cookies**, to add sessions when a user logs in, combining these two we can send the user to the home page when he is already signed in.

**js-cookies** lets you easily store data in cookies, **it's best practice to crypt the data you store if it's sensitive data, but since it's a only logged-in property so you don't have to.**
